Objective: 
The objective behind this attendance policy is to encourage attendance, monitor employees
regarding their punctuality and reduce absenteeism in the workplace. As per the attendance policy, 
all employees are expected to report to work on time and maintain the satisfactory record of 
attendance. In case an employee is unable to attend office, they are requested to inform their 
reporting manager within the start of 1 hour of office timings.
Applicability: 
All full time/Part Time/Contract employees. 
Procedure: 
1. The policy states that every employee must report to office on time and fulfill the hours of 
work. The usual office timings are from 10AM – 7PM, Monday to Friday, but the employee’s 
start time is established by the Supervisor or Manager based on business and production 
needs. 
2. Employees are expected to be at their work station in a fit condition and ready to work at 
starting time.
3. Hours of work is defined as 9 hours a day with 1 hour of break time. 
4. Filling of time sheets using the company provided application or as per the client 
requirement is mandatory, failure to do so would mean deduction of leaves.
5. Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled and on time. If it is impossible to 
report for work as scheduled, employees must call their manager before their starting time. 
If your manager is unavailable, then he/she must reach out to a buddy manager. In the 
event the employee cannot reach a Supervisor or Manager, the absence should be reported 
to the People’s Function/HR.
6. If the absence is to continue beyond the first day, the employee must notify their manager 
daily, unless otherwise arranged. Calling in is the responsibility of employee who is absent. 
Absence without intimation will be considered as unscheduled absenteeism and two such 
consecutive instances without notifying the manager will warrant for a disciplinary action. 
7. Attendance is extremely important to the success of the Company. We expect employees to 
strive for perfect attendance and to arrive for work on time. We recognize that, on occasion, 
you may not be able to come to work or need additional time before you arrive. Sickness 
and other emergencies cannot always be anticipated and may require you to miss all or part 
of your work day. 
8. If you cannot report to work as scheduled, you must notify your manager or the human 
resources department who will let your manager know your situation. If your need for time 
off is foreseeable, you must provide as much notice as possible. If your need for time off is 
not foreseeable, you must provide as much notice as practicable, but in no event less than 
two (2) hour prior to your normally scheduled starting time. Of course, if you cannot contact 
[e.g., your supervisor], you must have someone do it for you. 
9. When you contact your immediate supervisor, you must let them know for how long you 
will be out and when you expect to return or arrive for work.
